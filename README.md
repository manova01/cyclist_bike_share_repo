Introduction

Cyclistic is a Bike-Sharing coompany based in Chicago that offers single day passes, full day passes for casual users, and an annual subscription fee for its members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. The company has set a goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into members, and is looking to analyze the historical bike data trip to identify trends.

Problem Statements

Analysts believe that annual members are more profitable for the company than casual users, and that maximizing annual memberships is key to success.
The business-related problem statements that could be asked to improve the company's growth rate and success is shared below:

 1.   How do casual users and annual subcribed members use Cyclistic Bikes differently?
 2.   How can we design new marketing strategies to help convert casual members into annual members?
 
Preparing For Analysis
 
 This project has used 12 trip-data datasets from January 2022 to December 2022. Access the website and download the datasets provided as .zip files. Data is made available to the public or stored in a repository  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html . Rstudio is used to process and analyze the datasets. All of the datasets can be imported as .csv files to the database server and compared to the same data types of each column.

Conclusion

The analysis of 12 datasets revealed that casual users are more likely to use their bikes for a longer duration of time, and that user traffic for both summer  is highest for both groups and winter it significantly low. We can infer that casual users are more likely to use their bikes for a longer duration of time. Casual users are also more inclined to ride during evening hours of 3:00PM - 7PM and weekends is when most of the casual users prefer to ride. To better understand and convert casual users into buying annual memberships, the analysis provides factual evidence.

Recommendation

1.Provide a limited discount on annual memberships to increase rider usage during the low traffic months.
2.Provide free ride minutes for every minute of usage above 25 minutes, with only be redeemed on weekdays to promote rider usage.
3.Advertising should be used during peak hours and peak months to encourage people to explore bikes.
