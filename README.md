#Introduction
Cyclistic is a Bike-Sharing coompany based in Chicago that offers single day passes, full day passes for casual users, and an annual subscription fee for its members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. The company has set a goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into members, and is looking to analyze the historical bike data trip to identify trends.

#Problem Statements
Analysts believe that annual members are more profitable for the company than casual users, and that maximizing annual memberships is key to success.
The business-related problem statements that could be asked to improve the company's growth rate and success is shared below:

 1.   How do casual users and annual subcribed members use Cyclistic Bikes differently?
 2.   How can we design new marketing strategies to help convert casual members into annual members?
